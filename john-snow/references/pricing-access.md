# Pricing & Access Reference

## Net Price vs. List Price

### The ALMS Lesson

> "Sotyktu sales were flat y/y despite volume growth of 50-60% which suggests to me they are having net price and access issues."

**Always model NET price, not list price.**

### Typical Discount Factors

| Factor | Discount Range |
|--------|---------------|
| Rebates to PBMs | 20-40% |
| Patient assistance | 5-15% |
| 340B | 15-25% (for eligible) |
| Government pricing | 15-25% |
| **Total Net-to-List** | **50-70%** |

## Price/Volume Decomposition

Before extrapolating revenue:

```
Revenue = Price × Volume

Scenario A: Price cut
- Revenue flat, Volume up 50%
- Forward: Revenue may accelerate if price stabilizes

Scenario B: Price increase
- Revenue up, Volume flat
- Forward: Growth may slow, unsustainable
```

## Pricing Methods

| Method | When to Use |
|--------|-------------|
| Cost-plus | Generics, commodities |
| Competitive parity | Me-too drugs |
| Value-based | Differentiated products |
| ICER threshold | HTA markets (EU) |

## Access Dynamics

### US Commercial
- Formulary placement drives share
- Prior auth creates friction
- Step edits favor established drugs

### US Government
- Medicare Part D: Higher volume, lower price
- Medicare Part B: Buy-and-bill dynamics
- Medicaid: Best price requirements

### Ex-US
- Reference pricing limits upside
- ICER thresholds constrain premium
- Slower launches typical

## TYK2/Sotyktu Case Study

From ALMS exchange:
- List price high
- Net price deteriorating (50-60% volume growth, flat revenue)
- BMS pushing volume via patient connect
- Suggests pricing pressure will continue
- Third-to-market (ESK-001) will face same or worse dynamics
