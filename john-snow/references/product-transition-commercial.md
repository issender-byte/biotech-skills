# Product Transition Commercial Framework

Framework for analyzing forced product transitions where companies discontinue low-price products to drive adoption of high-price replacements.

---

## When to Use This Framework

| Situation | Use This Framework |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Company discontinuing legacy product for new version | Yes |
| Significant price increase between generations | Yes |
| Device + drug bundled products | Yes |
| Rare disease with limited competition | Yes |
| Payor leverage from "only approved therapy" | Yes |

---

## Framework 1: Forced Transition Economics

### The Strategy Pattern

Companies can force adoption of high-price products by:
1. **Discontinuing the low-price alternative** - removes physician choice
2. **Device bundling** - new capital equipment required, can't use old device
3. **Payor leverage** - rare disease + better outcomes = coverage pressure
4. **Provider economics** - make the switch profitable for hospitals/ASCs

### Price Escalation Math

| Metric | GKOS Example | Implication |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| Old product price | $4,000 (Photrexa) | Baseline |
| New product WAC | $78,500 (Epioxa) | 20x increase |
| Net price after GTN | $65-70K | ~15% GTN |
| Provider profit per procedure | $5-10K | Strong adoption incentive |

**Key Insight:** 
> "This could be a 5-10k drug profit on the procedure per eye. The economics are there for a hospital to switch."

When provider economics are strongly positive, adoption friction decreases dramatically.

### Discontinuation Timing

Companies typically discontinue old SKU when:
- "Supermajority" coverage achieved (not quantified, but implies >50-60%)
- J-code in place (reimbursement certainty)
- Tier 1 accounts converted
- Free drug/bridge programs absorbed initial demand

**GKOS Timeline:**
- J-code: July 1 (mechanical: 2 quarters ASP reporting)
- Photrexa discontinuation: "Sometime in 2026" after coverage established
- Interim: Medical exception only or free drug for denials

---

## Framework 2: Tiered Launch Strategy

### Distribution Concentration

When transitioning products, companies often concentrate distribution:

| GKOS Example | Old State | New State | Rationale |
|--------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Capital systems | 500-700 | 100-200 accounts | Focus on "centers of excellence" |
| Usage | Many underutilize | High-volume academic centers | Better compliance, appeals capability |

### Tier Definitions

| Tier | Definition | GKOS Criteria |
|------|------------|---------------|
| **Tier 1** | Centers of excellence | High-volume, academic, willing to do benefits/appeals, geographic access |
| **Tier 2-3** | Secondary accounts | Lower volume, less risk tolerance |
| **"In the closet"** | Non-adopters | Docs who don't do procedure anymore |

### Offsetting Concentrated Distribution

If going from 500-700 systems to 100-200 accounts, must offset with:
1. **Referral network investment** - educate ODs to refer to centers of excellence
2. **DTC marketing** - patient-driven demand
3. **Patient hub** - white-glove service to navigate access

**GKOS Quote:**
> "Only 1 in 5 patients being treated for KC today, charging 78,500 will have enough capital to find those patients and then expand that."

Revenue potential = (5x current patients) × (20x price) = **100x revenue opportunity** even with fewer treatment sites.

## Framework 3: Revenue Recognition During Transition

### Patient Buckets

During transition year, patients fall into distinct buckets with different revenue implications:

| Bucket | GKOS Definition | Revenue Impact |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Coverage secured** | Product shipped to qualified patient | Full revenue (elongated terms) |
| **Free drug program** | Income/geography qualified | COGS hit, no revenue |
| **Old product channel** | Can't access new, specialty pharmacy | Lower ASP revenue |
| **"Wait" bucket** | Delayed access until coverage secured | Deferred revenue |

### Modeling Implications

**For launch year:**
- Don't model 100% of volume at full price
- Model bucket mix explicitly
- Free drug = gross margin hit
- "Wait" bucket = timing risk

**GKOS Guidance:**
> "Expect modest revenues in 1H26, backend weighted for corneal health"

### J-Code Mechanical Timeline

| Quarter | Action | Result |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Q1 | Report ASP (first quarter) | — |
| Q2 | Report ASP (second quarter) | — |
| July 1 | J-code effective | Reimbursement certainty |

**Critical:** Revenue recognition possible before J-code using misc codes/new tech codes, but payor contracts required on account-by-account basis.

---

## Framework 4: Medicaid Economics Reversal

### The Problem with Legacy Products

Some legacy products have **negative margin on Medicaid** due to rebate structure:

| GKOS Example | Photrexa |
|--------------|----------|
| Sell price | $4,500 |
| Medicaid rebate bill | $4,900 |
| Net to company | **-$400** |

**Result:** No incentive to pursue Medicaid patients with old product.

### New Product Resets Economics

| GKOS Example | Epioxa |
|--------------|--------|
| WAC | $78,500 |
| Medicaid discount | 23% |
| Net to company | ~$60,000 |

**Result:** Medicaid segment becomes addressable market.

### Modeling Implication

If legacy product was avoiding Medicaid, new product TAM may be larger than legacy patient base suggests.

---

## Framework 5: Payor Leverage in Rare Disease

### Leverage Points

| Leverage | Description | GKOS Example |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| **Only approved therapy** | No alternative forces coverage | Epioxa is only epi-on crosslinking |
| **Better outcomes** | Clinical superiority claim | Better patient experience, less pain |
| **Rare disease** | Small budget impact | Keratoconus is rare |
| **Patient advocacy** | Patients push for access | "Will have enough capital to find those patients" |

### Timeline to Coverage

| Phase | Timeline | Activities |
|-------|----------|------------|
| Pre-launch | T-6 months | Payor conversations, advocacy prep |
| Launch | T+0 | Product available, initial accounts |
| Early adoption | T+3-9 months | Hospital P&T, commercial contracts |
| Broad coverage | T+9-12 months | Supermajority coverage |
| SKU discontinuation | T+12+ months | Force remaining volume |

**GKOS Timeline:**
> "Most of the drama comes from getting both the hospitals and the commercial payors to buy in which takes 3-9 months."

---

## Framework 6: Device-Drug Bundling

### Forced Capital Upgrade

When new drug requires new device:
- Customers can't use old device with new drug
- Capital cost becomes adoption barrier
- Trade-in/lease programs reduce friction

**GKOS Approach:**
> "The COGS on the new system is not material and they will offer existing customers the opportunity to trade-in Photrexa box and get a new Epioxa box. Or they can lease it."

### Generic Competition Barrier

Device bundling creates additional moat:
> "Someone could develop a generic of the old drug but the device used with the old drug is being phased out as well making the old drug even harder to use."

When both drug AND device are being discontinued, generic competition becomes structurally difficult.

## Case Study: GKOS Epioxa/Photrexa Transition

### Background

- **Drug:** Epioxa (epi-on crosslinking for keratoconus)
- **Legacy:** Photrexa ($4,000, epi-off procedure)
- **WAC:** $78,500 (20x increase)
- **Device:** New capital system required, trade-in offered

### Strategy Summary

| Element | GKOS Approach |
|---------|---------------|
| Price escalation | 20x ($4K → $78.5K) |
| Provider economics | $5-10K profit per eye |
| Distribution | 500-700 → 100-200 accounts (Tier 1 focus) |
| SKU discontinuation | "Sometime in 2026" after supermajority coverage |
| Payor leverage | Rare disease + better outcomes + no alternative |

### Launch Year Mechanics

| Quarter | Activity | Revenue Expectation |
|---------|----------|---------------------|
| Q1 2026 | Product available, Tier 1 placed | Modest (elongated terms) |
| Q2 2026 | J-code ASP reporting | Modest |
| July 1 | J-code effective | Acceleration |
| H2 2026 | Coverage broadens | Backend weighted |
| Late 2026 | Photrexa discontinuation | Full transition |

### Revenue Recognition Buckets

| Bucket | Description | Revenue |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| Coverage | Shipped to qualified patient | Full ($78.5K) |
| Free Epioxa | Income/geography qualified | COGS only |
| Photrexa | Can't access Epioxa | Lower ASP ($4.5K) |
| Wait | Coverage pending | Deferred |

### Bull Case

> "Market still isn't appreciating the value of Epioxa which is high probability of commercial success now that I have better understanding of their strategy with payor leverage around available therapies."

Elements supporting bull case:
1. Only 1 in 5 KC patients treated today → 5x volume opportunity
2. 20x price = 100x revenue potential even with fewer sites
3. Provider economics strongly positive
4. Rare disease payor leverage

### KOL Validation

**Dr. Hafler (Yale):**
> "Given the choice with equal coverage, use Epi-on... removes the biggest deterrent... probably increases real world treatment."

> "Whenever we get these new technologies, we want to explore. Expect uptake in 6 months to a year."

### Key Risks

1. **J-code timing** - mechanical, July 1 is locked
2. **Payor pushback** - 20x price increase may face resistance
3. **Account adoption** - hospitals must go through P&T process
4. **Tier 1 concentration** - fewer sites = geographic access risk

---

## Key Principles for Product Transitions

1. **Provider economics drive adoption** - if hospital makes $5-10K profit, they'll do the work
2. **Device bundling creates moat** - generic competition structurally difficult
3. **Tiered launch concentrates resources** - don't try to convert everyone
4. **SKU discontinuation is the lever** - forces remaining volume
5. **Revenue buckets matter in launch year** - don't model 100% at full price
6. **Rare disease = payor leverage** - small budget impact, no alternatives
7. **Treatment rate expansion** - can offset distribution concentration
8. **Medicaid economics may reverse** - check if legacy product avoided segment
