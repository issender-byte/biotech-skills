## Launch Performance Benchmarks (from exchanges)

### Launches That Underwhelmed

| Drug | Indication | Issue | Space Impact |
|------|------------|-------|--------------|
| Izervay/Syfovre | GA | Below TAM expectations | All GA de-rated |
| Leqembi | Alzheimer's | Slow uptake | Next-gen lost hype |
| Cobenfy | Schizophrenia | Below expectations | Muscarinic space de-rated |
| Sotyktu | Psoriasis | Slow growth, pricing pressure | TYK2 space de-rated |
| TAR-200 | NMIBC | TBD - early | Watching for space read-through |

### Launch Success Factors

| Factor | Positive | Negative |
|--------|----------|----------|
| Unmet need | High | Low/crowded |
| Physician familiarity | Known MOA | Novel/education needed |
| Payer access | Broad formulary | Prior auth, step edits |
| Administration | Oral/self-admin | Infusion/office visit |
| Competition | First-mover | Late entrant |

### Typical Launch Curves

| Launch Type | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 | Peak Year |
|-------------|--------|--------|--------|-----------|
| Strong | 15-25% | 40-60% | 70-85% | 4-5 |

| Slow | 5-10% | 15-25% | 30-45% | 7-10 |

## Space-Specific Analogs

### I&I (Dermatology)
- Dupilumab: Strong launch, $10B+ peak
- JAK inhibitors: Moderate (safety concerns)
- TYK2: Slow (differentiation unclear)

### Oncology (Supportive Care)
- Varies widely by tumor type and line

### CNS
- Generally slower launches (physician caution)
