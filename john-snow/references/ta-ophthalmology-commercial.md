## Source Cases

| Ticker | Drug | Market | Key Pattern | Source |
|--------|------|--------|-------------|--------|
| OCUL | Axpaxli | wAMD, DME | Durability positioning, strategic interest | Adrian, ZH |
| EYPT | EYP-1901 | wAMD, DME | Comparable positioning | RP |
| Regeneron | Eylea/HD Eylea | wAMD, DME | SOC benchmark | — |
| Roche | Vabysmo | wAMD, DME | Durability premium | — |

## Market Overview

### Total Market Size

| Indication | US Market | Global | Growth |
|------------|-----------|--------|--------|
| wAMD | ~$8B | ~$12B | 3-5% |
| DME | ~$5B | ~$8B | 5-7% |
| Total Anti-VEGF | ~$15B | ~$22B | 4-6% |

**Key insight (Adrian):** "$15B market so any use can get drug to $1B in peak sales"

### Current Market Share (US)

| Drug | Share | Dosing | Notes |
|------|-------|--------|-------|
| Eylea | ~55% | Q8W | SOC, generic 2024+ |
| Vabysmo | ~25% | Q12-16W | Growing rapidly |
| Lucentis | ~10% | Monthly/PRN | Declining |
| Beovu | ~5% | Q8-12W | Safety concerns |
| Others | ~5% | — | Biosimilars emerging |

### Vabysmo as Durability Benchmark

> "Vabysmo is annualizing $3.5B... with similar dosing interval" (ZH)

Vabysmo sold $4B in 2024. Achieved rapid uptake based on durability claim (up to Q16W).

**Implication:** Market has appetite for durability. Drug with 6-month dosing could achieve significant share if efficacy comparable.

---

## Commercial Framework: Durability Drugs

### The Value Proposition

| Factor | Standard Anti-VEGF | Durability Implant |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Dosing frequency | Q4-8W | Q24W (target) |
| Patient visits/year | 6-13 | 2 |
| Injection burden | High | Low |
| Patient preference | Neutral | Strong |
| Physician workflow | Standard | New procedure |

### Adoption Barriers

| Barrier | Description | Mitigation |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| **Procedural learning curve** | Implant injection different from IVT | Training programs, proctoring |
| **Reimbursement uncertainty** | New J-code, ASP unknown | J-code application, early WAC signals |
| **Safety concerns** | New mechanism | Robust Ph3 safety database |
| **Efficacy skepticism** | "Good enough" with current Rx | Clear superiority on durability |
| **Referral pattern disruption** | Retina specialists control market | KOL engagement |

### Launch Curve Expectations

Based on Vabysmo trajectory (fastest launch in ophthalmology history):

| Year | Vabysmo Sales | % of Peak | Notes |
|------|---------------|-----------|-------|
| L+1 | ~$2.0B | ~40% | Rapid uptake |
| L+2 | ~$3.0B | ~60% | Continued growth |
| L+3 | ~$4.0B | ~80% | Approaching maturity |
| L+4+ | ~$5.0B | 100% | Peak |

**Conservative implant estimate:** Slower uptake due to procedural barriers.

| Year | Implant Sales | % of Peak | Notes |
|------|---------------|-----------|-------|
| L+1 | $200-400M | 10-20% | Slow start |
| L+2 | $500-800M | 25-40% | Building |
| L+3 | $800M-1.2B | 40-60% | Accelerating |
| L+4 | $1.2-1.8B | 60-90% | Maturing |
| L+5+ | $1.5-2.5B | 100% | Peak |

---

## Peak Sales Framework

### OCUL Axpaxli (ZH Analysis)

| Scenario | Peak Sales | PoS | Rationale |
|----------|------------|-----|-----------|
| **Bull** | $2.5-4B | 25% | Near-Vabysmo share, 6m durability proven |
| **Base** | $1.5-2B | 50% | Meaningful durability, some efficacy trade-off |
| **Bear** | $500M-1B | 25% | Niche use, safety/efficacy concerns |

**ZH's thesis:** "With every 6 month dosing, I think OTX-TKI should at least take similar market share as Vabysmo"

### Street Consensus (Adrian)

> "Unadjusted Peak Sales: Range $1B-$3.5B, Mean $1.9B, Median $1.7B"

**Key assumption:** "Most believe on a clear win peak sales can move to the $2-3B range"

### Implied Valuation (ZH)

At 50% PoS, stock prices in ~$1.4B peak sales.

| Assumption | Peak Sales Implied | Current Price Reflects |
|------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| 50% PoS × $1.4B | $700M risk-adj | Conservative |
| 60% PoS × $2.0B | $1.2B risk-adj | Moderate |
| 70% PoS × $2.5B | $1.75B risk-adj | Bullish |

## Competitive Dynamics

### TKI Implant Landscape

| Company | Drug | Stage | Timing | Positioning |
|---------|------|-------|--------|-------------|
| OCUL | Axpaxli | Ph3 | 1Q26 (SOL-1) | 6-month wAMD |
| EYPT | EYP-1901 | Ph2/3 | 2H26 | Similar |
| Clearside | — | Ph2 | 2027+ | SCS delivery |

### OCUL vs EYPT (RP Analysis)

> "EYPT is ahead on timing"

**Competitive question:** Does OCUL's earlier data read give them commercial advantage, or is EYPT's similar mechanism a validation?

| Factor | OCUL | EYPT |
|--------|------|------|
| Data timing | 1Q26 (SOL-1) | 2H26 |
| Ph2 data | Mixed (Australia flawed) | Cleaner |
| Commercial readiness | Strong | Developing |
| Strategic interest | High (per mgmt) | Unknown |

### Biosimilar Threat

Eylea biosimilars emerging (2024+). Impact:
- Price erosion on aflibercept-based therapies
- Strengthens case for differentiated products (durability)
- Could accelerate adoption of premium options

---

## M&A Considerations

### Strategic Interest (Adrian)

> "Mgmt has not been shy about attracting strategic interest & believe positive data here will strengthen that interest"

### Potential Acquirers

| Company | Rationale | Fit |
|---------|-----------|-----|
| **Regeneron** | Defend Eylea franchise | High |
| **Roche** | Complement Vabysmo | Medium |
| **AbbVie** | Build ophthalmology | Medium |
| **J&J** | Portfolio expansion | Low-Medium |

### M&A Valuation Framework

For ophthalmology assets:

| Metric | Range | OCUL Application |
|--------|-------|------------------|
| EV/Peak Sales | 2-4x | $3-6B on $1.5B peak |
| Upfront as % of deal | 60-80% | — |
| Commercial milestone % | 20-40% | — |

**Bear case (MM):** "Upside to me is in the 0%-40% range (65% of $1-1.5bn peak)"

Translation: MM sees max upside of ~$1B peak × 65% probability = $650M risk-adjusted, or 0-40% stock upside.

## Key Commercial Debates

### Debate 1: Durability vs Efficacy Trade-off

**Bull case (ZH, RP):**
- 6-month durability is highly differentiated
- Patients/physicians will accept modest efficacy trade-off
- Market is moving toward durability (Vabysmo success proves this)

**Bear case (MM):**
- If efficacy is meaningfully worse (4 letters BCVA, 50-100um CST), drug loses value proposition
- "Just give people a single dose of Eylea" if implant is worse
- Durability benefit evaporates if efficacy gap is too large

### Debate 2: SOL-1 Read-Through to SOL-R

**Bull case (ZH):**
- SOL-1 success validates mechanism
- SOL-R (DME) has larger market opportunity
- Positive data increases SOL-R PoS by 25%

**Bear case (MM):**
- "This trial isn't actually derisking for the next trial"
- "It just tells you that implant beats 1 dose of Eylea, who cares"
- Different patient population, different competitive dynamics

### Debate 3: Strategic vs Commercial Path

**Long-term commercial (ZH):**
- Build franchise around 6-month dosing
- Multiple indications (wAMD, DME, NPDR)
- Peak sales $2-4B

**Strategic exit (Adrian):**
- Positive data triggers M&A interest
- Premium for differentiated technology
- Exit before commercial risk

## Real-World Evidence Considerations

### What to Track Post-Approval

| Metric | Why It Matters |
|--------|----------------|
| **Redosing interval** | Actual durability in real world |
| **BCVA maintenance** | Are patients seeing as well? |
| **Switch rate** | Are patients leaving after trial? |
| **Physician adoption curve** | Is procedural barrier real? |
| **Payer coverage** | Access and reimbursement |

### NPDR Opportunity (Debate)

Both OCUL and EYPT pursuing NPDR (non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy).

**Bull case:**
- Large unmet need (earlier intervention)
- Durable therapy could prevent progression

**Bear case (Adrian):**
- "Longer term questions around commercial adoption"
- "Skepticism on use case/true market in NPDR"
