## Quality Checklist

Before submitting a 5PTer:

```
CONTENT QUALITY:
□ Recommendation is clear (direction, size, price)
□ Conviction level is explicit with upside/downside ranges
□ All debates have both bull and bear cases
□ Probabilities are assigned and justified
□ Scenarios sum to 100%
□ Prob-weighted EV is calculated
□ Key catalysts are dated
□ Backup data supports main arguments
□ KOL/expert input is incorporated where relevant
□ Competitive positioning is addressed
□ Risk factors are explicit
□ Position sizing recommendation is realistic

PROVENANCE (Rules 40-45):
□ Every trial result has a citation
□ Competitor data is sourced (not recalled from memory)
□ Claims of "failure" or "success" are verified
□ No specific percentages without traceable source
□ Contrary evidence is verified before citing
□ Uncertainty is flagged where data is incomplete

STATED VIEW REQUIREMENT:
□ Author states a position (even if tentative/uncertain)
□ PoS estimate is given as a number or range (not "TBD")
□ If uncertain, states what would resolve the uncertainty
□ Does not end with "more work needed" without a preliminary view
□ Clinical bar defined for each commercial scenario
□ Commercial implications stated for each mechanism finding
```

## Stated View Policy

**We invest in public markets. Opportunities are fleeting. We cannot afford weeks of analysis before forming a view.**

Every research piece must end with a stated position:

```
STATED VIEW FORMAT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

MY VIEW: [Bull/Bear/Neutral] with [X%] confidence

PoS: [X-Y%] for [primary endpoint]
Fair Value: $[X-Y] per share
Current Price: $[Z] → [Over/Under]valued

Key uncertainty: [What I don't know]
What would change my view: [Specific data/event]

Preliminary sizing: [X bps] subject to [conditions]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**Acceptable uncertainty statements:**
- "PoS 40-60% - wide range because [specific reason]. Would narrow to 55-65% if [specific data]."
- "Leaning bearish (55% confidence) but need to verify [specific thing] before sizing."
- "Tentatively 50 bps long, will add to 100 bps if Ph2 shows ≥20% delta."

**Unacceptable:**
- "More work needed before forming a view."
- "Interesting setup, will revisit later."
- "TBD pending further analysis."
- [No view stated at all]

**Why this matters:**
Analysis without a view is a literature review. The market doesn't wait for perfect information. A tentative view that gets updated is more valuable than no view at all.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Problem | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Vague recommendation | "Could be interesting" | Explicit Buy/Sell/Hold + size |
| Missing bear case | One-sided analysis | Steel-man the counter-thesis |
| Unstated probabilities | Can't assess conviction | Assign % to every outcome |
| Stale data | Markets move | Update price/EV before sending |
| Missing catalyst dates | No timeline | Pin down specific quarters |
| Overly complex | Too long to read | Executive summary should stand alone |
| No backup | Claims without evidence | Include data tables |
