## Framework: KOL Value by Question Type

### What KOLs Are Good For

| Question Type | KOL Value | Why |
|---------------|-----------|-----|
| Clinical practice patterns | Very High | They live it daily |
| Patient selection criteria | Very High | They make these decisions |
| Competitive positioning | High | They use all the drugs |
| Tolerability reality | High | Patients tell them |
| Payer/access friction | Medium-High | They fight the battles |
| Data interpretation | Medium | May have biases |
| Trial design critique | Medium | Limited regulatory experience |
| Peak sales estimates | Low | Not their expertise |

### What KOLs Are NOT Good For

| Question Type | Why Not |
|---------------|---------|
| Market sizing | They see their practice, not epidemiology |
| Pricing strategy | Not their domain |
| Competitive company strategy | They don't think like businesspeople |
| Timeline predictions | Usually optimistic |
| Regulatory outcomes | FDA is a black box to most |

## Framework: Weighting KOL Input

### KOL Credibility Assessment

| Factor | High Weight | Low Weight |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| **Volume** | High prescriber in indication | Low volume/peripheral |
| **Trial involvement** | Principal investigator | No trial involvement |
| **Independence** | No sponsor relationship | Paid consultant/speaker |
| **Specificity** | Cites specific cases/data | Vague generalities |
| **Consistency** | View aligns with actions | Says one thing, does another |

### Integrating Multiple KOLs

| Scenario | How to Weight |
|----------|---------------|
| All KOLs agree | High confidence in consensus |
| Academic vs community split | Community often more predictive of adoption |
| US vs EU split | Weight by target market |
| KOL vs data conflict | Data wins, but investigate discrepancy |

## Framework: KOL Call Structure

### Pre-Call Preparation

1. **Identify specific questions** you can't answer from public data
2. **Prepare context** so KOL understands relevance
3. **Know their potential biases** (trial involvement, competitor relationships)

### Question Types

| Type | Example | What You Learn |
|------|---------|----------------|
| **Behavioral** | "How do you currently select patients for X?" | Real-world practice |
| **Comparative** | "How does Y compare to Z in your experience?" | Competitive dynamics |
| **Predictive** | "How would data showing A change your practice?" | Adoption drivers |
| **Validation** | "Does this align with your experience?" | Sanity check |

### Red Flags During Call

| Red Flag | Interpretation |
|----------|---------------|
| Vague answers | May not have direct experience |
| Too promotional | May be conflicted |
| Contradicts own data | May be speculating |
| "I've heard" | Second-hand, less reliable |

## Case Study: TERN KOL Integration

### Context
Dr. Shah KOL call regarding CML market and TERN-701 positioning

### Key KOL Quotes

**On Data Presentation:**
> "Data presentation is 'unfortunate' and 'adds a layer of confusion and cloudiness'"

**Interpretation:** KOL is signaling that company is not being transparent, which is a clinical PoS risk factor.

**On Competitive Positioning:**
> "MMR is hard endpoint... place less stock in MMR as an endpoint"

**Interpretation:** KOL is reframing how to think about efficacy in this space - affects both clinical assessment (reverend-bayes) and commercial positioning (john-snow).

### How This Changed Analysis

| Before KOL | After KOL | Impact |
|------------|-----------|--------|
| Took MMR at face value | Discounted MMR endpoint | -5% PoS |
| Company message accepted | Skeptical of data presentation | -5% PoS |
| Standard CML assumptions | Nuanced competitive view | Refined share model |

## Key Principles

1. **KOLs are most valuable for practice patterns** - How they actually use drugs, not what they think about trials
2. **Weight independence over prestige** - Unpaid community docs often more honest than paid academic KOLs
3. **Specificity is signal** - Vague answers = lack of experience
4. **Cross-reference with data** - KOL opinion ≠ truth; validate against hard data
5. **Track their predictions** - Build KOL track record over time
