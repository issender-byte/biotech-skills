### RP - Analyst

**Primary Skills:** reverend-bayes (clinical read-through, biomarker validation, kinetics analysis)

**Role:** Clinical analysis with strong emphasis on prior failure read-through, biomarker coherence, and data quality assessment.

**Strengths:**
- **Prior failure search discipline** - Searches clinicaltrials.gov for mechanism + indication. Found MEDI8968 (IL-1R) failure in HS that others missed.
- **Biomarker validation framework** - "If biomarker moves as expected, underdosed thesis is refuted." MAS825 IL-6 down 50%, MEDI8968 CRP/fibrinogen down in COPD.
- **Time-course kinetics analysis** - Notes inconsistent separation, high dose = placebo at intermediate timepoints. "Kinetics are odd."
- **Positive control benchmarking** - Compares to Bimzelx (known winner) to establish "what good kinetics look like."
- **Error bar discipline** - Notes when CIs are wide/overlapping and what that means for confidence.
- **Questions assumptions** - Challenged "underdosed" thesis with specific biomarker evidence.

**Development Areas:**
- TBD - early observation period

**Coaching Approach:**
- Leverage his rigor to set standards for others
- Use his analyses as teaching examples

**Key Analytical Contributions:**
1. MEDI8968 (IL-1R) failure in HS read-through - most damning evidence against IL-1 single-isoform thesis
2. Biomarker-clinical disconnect pattern - target engagement ≠ clinical efficacy
3. Time-course consistency framework - consistent separation > end-of-study separation
4. Positive control benchmarking - what does success look like?

## Individual Profiles

### ZH - Analyst (Clinical/Idea Generation)

**Primary Skills:** reverend-bayes, graham (model building)

**Role:** Identify investment opportunities, build initial thesis and valuation model, pitch ideas to team.

**Strengths:**
- Good pattern recognition on setups
- Finds interesting opportunities
- Builds structurally sound valuation models (scenario analysis, BIC/me-too/fail buckets)
- Thinks about dose-response and competitive positioning
- Frames key debates correctly

**Development Areas:**
1. **Engaging contrary evidence** - Tendency to dismiss or ignore data that challenges thesis. Example: AVTX pitch didn't address bermekimab or MAS825 read-through.
2. **Intellectual honesty about uncertainty** - Overstates confidence (75% PoS on AVTX without addressing key mechanism debate).
3. **Factual accuracy** - Claimed "IL-1β is elevated but not IL-1α" which was incorrect.
4. **Prior failure search** - Didn't search clinicaltrials.gov for prior IL-1 trials in HS. MEDI8968 (IL-1R) failed in HS - directly relevant read-through. Standard practice: search "[mechanism] + [indication]" on clinicaltrials.gov before pitching.

**Coaching Approach:**
- Have him write the bear thesis in his own words before discussing
- Ask "What's the best argument against this?" before sizing
- Require explicit engagement with competitor failures/read-throughs
- Check factual claims against literature

**Coaching Script (Post-AVTX):**
> "ZH, you found a good setup and the model mechanics are solid. The gap is intellectual honesty about contrary evidence. You dismissed bermekimab and MAS825 as 'not relevant' without engaging with them. Good analysts steel-man the bear case, not explain it away. Next pitch, write out the bear thesis first - that exercise reveals where assumptions are weakest."

**Progress Tracking:**
| Date | Observation | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 2026-01-26 | AVTX pitch: Good setup, didn't address bermekimab/MAS825 | Coaching delivered |
| 2026-01-27 | AVTX follow-up (RP feedback): Missed MEDI8968 (IL-1R) failure in HS (NCT01838499). This is critical read-through - if blocking the receptor (which captures ALL IL-1α/β signaling) failed, why would blocking one ligand work? Should have searched clinicaltrials.gov for IL-1 + HS. Also didn't benchmark kinetics against Bimzelx or note wide error bars. RP also contributed: (1) Biomarker validation defeats "underdosed" thesis - MAS825 IL-6 down 50%, MEDI8968 CRP/fibrinogen down in COPD = target engagement happened but didn't translate clinically; (2) Time-course kinetics - high dose = placebo at Week 8 on HiSCR75, inconsistent separation is red flag; (3) Positive control discipline - compare to Bimzelx which shows consistent separation. All demonstrate analytical rigor ZH should aspire to. | Additional gaps identified (RP) |
| 2026-01-27 | AVTX counter to RP: **Good framework** - compiled IC50/dosing comparison table across IL-1 drugs (Anakinra, Canakinumab, Luti, Bermekimab, MAS825, LY2189102). Correctly challenged oversimplified receptor-blocker read-through. Valid MAS825 dosing concern (q2w→q4w). **Gap:** Claims MAS825 ≈ Luti 100mg exposure but never shows Ctrough/IC50 math. Missing: (1) Actual Ctrough data for each molecule, (2) Luti dose-response (did 300mg > 100mg?), (3) MEDI8968 IC50 comparison invalid (receptor blocker vs ligand neutralizer), (4) Anakinra paradox unexplained (short t½, weak IC50, yet works). Counter is directionally reasonable but **unproven without exposure calculations**. | Improved framework, missing math |

### Ben - Commercial Analyst

**Primary Skills:** john-snow

**Role:** Molecule history, IP/exclusivity analysis, competitive landscape, peak sales estimation, commercial positioning.

**Strengths:**
- Excellent molecule provenance research (ownership chains, indication pivots)
- Strong IP/exclusivity analysis (COM expiry, BPCIA, royalty structures)
- Good competitive landscape mapping with sources
- Sophisticated frameworks (SSE vs DSE biosimilar dynamics)
- Connects PK to commercial positioning (half-life → dosing interval)

**Development Areas:**
1. **Clinical bar definition** - Gives peak sales scenarios without defining what efficacy data distinguishes them. Commercial needs to tell clinical "here's what the data needs to show."
2. **Stating views** - Provides analysis without conclusions. Doesn't give PoS input or recommend position.
3. **Competitive timing** - Says "not significantly behind" without quantifying the gap.

**Coaching Approach:**
- Require clinical bar for each commercial scenario
- Ask "What HiSCR delta separates your me-better from me-too?"
- Push for specific launch timing assumptions
- Remind that commercial informs clinical, not just receives from it

**Coaching Script (Post-AVTX):**
> "Ben, this is strong commercial work - molecule history, IP timeline, comp landscape, biosimilar dynamics. Two things would make it actionable: First, define the clinical bar. You said $1.5bn vs $750mn - what efficacy delta separates those? That's the handoff back to clinical. Second, competitive timing - 'not significantly behind' needs a number. Is it 6 months? 18 months?"

**Progress Tracking:**
| Date | Observation | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 2026-01-26 | AVTX analysis: Good commercial work, no clinical bar, no stated view | Coaching delivered |

### LA - Science/Commercial Hybrid

**Primary Skills:** reverend-bayes + john-snow

**Role:** Bridge between clinical science and commercial analysis. Mechanistic deep dives, competitor read-through, pathway mapping.

**Strengths:**
- Identifies core debates quickly and accurately
- Excellent provenance discipline (every claim cited)
- Strong mechanistic reasoning (pathway mapping, read-through logic)
- Intellectual honesty (acknowledges uncertainty, presents both sides)
- Corrects others' errors with actual data (bermekimab correction)

**Development Areas:**
1. **Stating views** - Lays out debates beautifully but doesn't say where he lands. Analysis reads like literature review, not investment recommendation.
2. **Commercial integration** - Despite hybrid role, delivers 100% science without connecting to commercial scenarios.
3. **Decision criteria** - Identifies uncertainty but doesn't define what data would resolve it.

**Coaching Approach:**
- Require a stated PoS at end of every analysis
- Ask "After all this work, where do you come out?"
- Push for explicit mapping of mechanism debates to commercial scenarios
- Ask "If you're uncertain, what would resolve it?"

**Coaching Script (Post-AVTX):**
> "LA, this is the best piece of work in the thread. You identified the core debate, cited sources, mapped the mechanism, and flagged uncertainty honestly. Two things would make it complete: First, state a view - you've laid out why IL-1α might matter and why there's uncertainty. Where do you land? Is your PoS closer to ZH's 75% or 40-55%? Second, connect to commercial - Ben gave us $1.5bn vs $750mn. Does the IL-1α debate map to those scenarios? You're the bridge - build it explicitly."

**Progress Tracking:**
| Date | Observation | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 2026-01-26 | AVTX analysis: Excellent mechanistic work, no stated view, no commercial connection | Coaching delivered |
| 2026-01-27 | CGON PIVOT-006: **Major improvement on stated view** - provided 50-65% control range, 15-20% delta point estimate, narrow success window parameters. Built simulations (Ming Zhu verified). Excellent provenance (Lee/Lewicki 2022, EORTC, NCCN 2024, management Q&A, KOL feedback). Cross-trial meta-analysis for HR NMIBC. Still needs commercial integration (no peak sales connection). | Coaching delivered |

### CV (Cia Varelas) - Junior Analyst (Commercial)

**Primary Skills:** john-snow, keynes

**Role:** Commercial analysis with emphasis on script tracking, KOL channel checks, and positioning/squeeze risk. Most junior team member.

**Strengths:**
- **Leads with actionable recommendation** - "SS 25 bps above $2.50" with specific price level and sizing. Doesn't bury conclusions.
- **Script tracking methodology** - Builds PSFs/wk → consensus waterfall with capture rate validation (102% across 3Q25/4Q25).
- **KOL channel checks with attribution** - Named physicians, direct quotes, forced rankings. Primary research, not desk work.
- **Squeeze risk identification** - Correctly identifies SI/float dynamics, insider ownership impact, and catalyst triggers. Shows Keynes-style thinking about "how we lose money even if thesis is correct."
- **Competitive displacement framework** - Connects PE practice consolidation → protocol-driven prescribing → systematic deprioritization.
- **Provenance discipline** - All major claims sourced with links.

**Development Areas:**
1. **Clinical PoS quantification** - Lists indication expansion catalysts but says "low probability" without numbers. Needs to provide PoS estimate for each catalyst.
2. **Implied PoS back-solve** - Doesn't calculate what stock implies for expansion. Can't assess if short is fighting consensus or confirming it.
3. **"What makes me wrong" section** - Identifies squeeze risk but doesn't quantify pain scenarios (how bad can this get?).
4. **Thin consensus flag resolution** - Notes only 3 brokers but doesn't address what sellside bull case looks like.

**Coaching Approach:**
- Acknowledge strong commercial work first
- Push for clinical PoS estimates (even if outside primary lane)
- Require quantification of adverse scenarios for shorts
- Ask "What does the stock assume?" on every thesis

**Coaching Script (Post-IBRX):**
> "CV, this is strong commercial work - the script tracking, KOL checks, and squeeze risk section are exactly what we need. Three things would sharpen it: First, quantify the indication expansion PoS. You said 'low probability' but the 1L NMIBC interim (85% vs 57%) isn't nothing - give me a number for each catalyst. Second, define what makes you wrong. If BCG shortage resolves or 1L captures the market, how bad does the squeeze get? Third, back-solve the implied PoS. What does the stock assume for expansion? That tells us if we're fighting consensus or confirming it."

**Key Analytical Contributions:**
1. Float concentration squeeze risk - TRUE float calculation when insiders own large blocks
2. J-code transition timing - Predictable reimbursement catalyst at 6-9 months post-approval
3. PE practice consolidation impact - Protocol-driven prescribing displaces WIC drugs
4. Script capture rate validation - 102% capture instills confidence in extrapolation
5. BCG dependency as competitive disadvantage - Inheriting scarce SOC limitations

**Progress Tracking:**
| Date | Observation | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 2026-01-28 | IBRX pitch: Strong commercial work with actionable rec. Good KOL checks, squeeze risk section (Keynes). Gaps: no clinical PoS for catalysts, no implied PoS back-solve, no quantified adverse scenario. | Coaching to deliver |

### WS - Biostatistician / Idea Generation

**Primary Skills:** reverend-bayes (statistical framework, power analysis, E-R)

**Role:** Biostatistician who also generates investment ideas. Evaluate trial designs, power assumptions, cross-trial comparisons.

**Strengths:**
- Leads with stated PoS (doesn't bury conclusions)
- Builds explicit power tables with sourced assumptions
- Strong dose-response / E-R analysis
- Good cross-trial design comparison (parallel vs RW, SLNO analog)
- Flags key uncertainties (E-R plateau concern)
- Endpoint granularity awareness (scale ranges, SD differences)
- Historical context integration (prior failures, FDA feedback)

**Development Areas:**
1. **Valuation/implied PoS gap** - Gives PoS but doesn't compare to market implied. Can't act on 30% PoS without knowing if market is at 15% or 50%.
2. **Thesis tension resolution** - Flags concerns (E-R plateau) but doesn't fully resolve how they inform the PoS. Make logic explicit.
3. **Citation completeness** - Has specific numbers but doesn't always cite sources (PK data, preclinical claims).
4. **Commercial framing** - Not his primary role, but one sentence on market size/competitive context would help.

**Coaching Approach:**
- Acknowledge strong statistical work first
- Push for "so what" - implied PoS comparison
- Ask him to make thesis logic explicit when flagging concerns
- Light touch on commercial - not his lane, but helpful context

**Coaching Script (Post-ACAD):**
> "WS, this is strong reverend-bayes work. You led with 30% PoS, built a power table, did real E-R analysis, and flagged the plateau concern. Three things would make it actionable: First, what's the market implying? If ACAD implies 50%, this is a short. Second, resolve the plateau tension - you flagged it but didn't say how it informs your 30%. Third, add sources for the PK/preclinical numbers."

**Progress Tracking:**
| Date | Observation | Status |
|------|-------------|--------|
| 2026-01-27 | ACAD pitch: Strong reverend-bayes work (power table, E-R, cross-trial). Led with PoS. Gaps: no implied PoS comparison, thesis tension unresolved, incomplete citations. | Coaching to deliver |
| 2026-01-27 | ACAD follow-up (AG/MM feedback): Missed 3 key patterns: (1) "Juice left to squeeze" - DB delta is marginal after OL ceiling, not "true" effect; (2) Cross-indication validation - should test methodology on PDP where ground truth exists; (3) NPIC non-linearity - didn't flag scale interpretation issues. Also missed: original PIMA wasn't powered for ADP subpop, QTc absence enables dose headroom. | Senior feedback received |
| 2026-01-28 | ACAD response to AG/MM (Round 2): **Good engagement** - found DRP table showing stable drug arm, identified key placebo rebound anomaly (only 10-15% rebound after 18wks = suspicious), did cross-indication comparison (PDP vs ADP) per MM's request with 3 figures, arrived at quantified view (<3 delta in ADP based on 3.37 PDP parallel data). Defended his view with data while conceding valid points (SAPS-H+D granularity, 2x dosing helpful). **Gaps:** (1) Effect size 0.2 → power calc missing (what's PoS if ES=0.2, powered for 0.4?); (2) No implied PoS back-solve from stock price; (3) "Can ask mgmt" on dose-response without follow-up plan; (4) Dismissed NPIC→SAPS-H+D comparison without attempting conversion. Overall: B+ PM-level engagement with senior feedback. | Good progress |

## Team Integration Patterns

### The AVTX Example

The AVTX thread showed classic integration failure:

| Analyst | Contribution | Gap |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| ZH | Setup, model, thesis | Didn't engage contrary evidence |
| Ben | IP, commercial, comp landscape | Didn't define clinical bar |
| LA | Mechanism debate, citations | Didn't state view or connect to commercial |

**The team had all the pieces but didn't integrate them.**

ZH's model + Ben's commercial framework + LA's mechanism analysis = complete thesis

But no one synthesized it.

### Required Integration Points

For any investment thesis, ensure:

```
INTEGRATION CHECKLIST
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

CLINICAL → COMMERCIAL:
□ Mechanism debates mapped to commercial scenarios
□ PoS provided for each commercial bar
□ Competitor read-through implications stated

COMMERCIAL → CLINICAL:
□ Clinical bar defined for each peak sales scenario
□ What efficacy data distinguishes scenarios?
□ Secondary differentiation factors identified

SYNTHESIS:
□ Someone owns the integrated view (PM or coordinator)
□ Prob-weighted EV calculated
□ Position sizing recommendation made
□ Everyone stated a view (even if tentative)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

## Coaching Philosophy

### Core Principles

1. **Everyone states a view** - Analysis without a conclusion is a literature review. Tentative views that get updated are more valuable than no view.

2. **Engage contrary evidence** - Good analysts steel-man the bear case. Dismissing contrary data is a correctable habit, not a fundamental flaw.

3. **Bidirectional handoffs** - Clinical and commercial inform each other. Neither is independent.

4. **Provenance discipline** - Every number needs a source. "I recall seeing" is not a citation.

5. **Public markets urgency** - We don't have weeks to analyze. Form a view, update it as data comes in.

### Coaching Cadence

| Frequency | Activity |
|-----------|----------|
| Per pitch | Quick feedback on gaps, stated view requirement |
| Weekly | Pattern review - what did we learn? |
| Monthly | Individual development check-ins |
| Quarterly | Role clarity and skill progression |

### Development Tracking

For each team member, track:
- Specific incidents (what happened)
- Coaching delivered (what we said)
- Progress observed (did it improve?)
- Patterns (recurring issues vs one-offs)
