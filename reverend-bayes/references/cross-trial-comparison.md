## When to Use This Framework

| Situation | Use This Framework |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Single-arm trial needs historical benchmark | Yes - cross-trial comparison |
| "Drug A beat Drug B, Drug B beat Drug C, so Drug A should beat Drug C" | Yes - transitive efficacy logic |
| Comparator arm looks different than historical | Yes - comparator skepticism |
| Commercial launch of competitor could affect your stock | Yes - launch overhang analysis |
| Setting expectations for upcoming data readout | Yes - explicit bar-setting |

## Part 1: Cross-Trial Comparison Methodology

### The Mike Method: Setting Explicit Bars

**Don't say "data looks good" - say "need >X% to derisk Y thesis."**

### Framework

1. **Gather comparator data** - Multiple trials, large n, rigorous design
2. **Identify the benchmark range** - What did SOC achieve?
3. **Set explicit thresholds** - What would be "clearly better"? "In line"? "Concerning"?
4. **Quantify the bar** - Specific numbers, not vibes

### Example: CGON in 1L NMIBC

**Step 1: Gather BCG Comparator Data**

| Trial | N | BCG Regimen | Anytime CR | 12M EFS | Source |
|-------|---|-------------|------------|---------|--------|
| PFE Ph3 | ~300 | BCG-M | 85-90% | ~84% | Big pharma |
| AZN Ph3 | ~300 | BCG-M | 88-93% | ~87% | Big pharma |
| IBRX Ph2/3 | 20 | BCG-M | 61% | - | Small biotech |
| **Consensus** | ~1000 | BCG-M | **85-93%** | **80-87%** | |

**Step 2: Note the Outlier**

IBRX's BCG arm showed only 61% anytime CR vs 85-93% in big pharma trials. Why?
- Small n (20 patients) = high variance
- Different BCG strain (TICE vs non-TICE)?
- Induction only vs maintenance?
- IBRX trial quality concerns?

**Mike's challenge:** "I'd caution that the 3 trials I sent were rigorous ones from big pharma with total n=~1000 versus just a 20 vs 20 study conducted by IBRX, who we know are shady."

**Step 3: Set Explicit Thresholds**

| CGON Result | Interpretation |
|-------------|----------------|
| >93% anytime CR, >88% 12M EFS | Very positive - clearly derisks 1L |
| 90-93% anytime CR, 85-88% 12M EFS | Positive - derisks combo strategy |
| 85-90% anytime CR, 80-85% 12M EFS | Neutral - in line with BCG, doesn't derisk |
| <85% anytime CR | Concerning - worse than BCG benchmark |

**Step 4: Connect to Thesis**

"The positive studies showed ~5% CR delta over BCG-M. The failed study showed only 2% delta. You'd need to see something >5% better than BCG's expected 85-93% to believe cross-trial that 1L is high PoS for CGON, but a 90-98% anytime CR rate seems like a very high bar."

## Part 2: Transitive Efficacy Logic

### The Pattern

```
Premise 1: Drug A beat Drug B in Setting X
Premise 2: Drug C beat Drug A in Setting Y
Conclusion: Drug C should beat Drug B in Setting X
```

### When It's Valid

| Condition | Valid? | Example |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Same indication, same endpoint, same population | Usually | CGON beat IBRX in 2L CIS → relevant to 2L |
| Different line of therapy | Risky | 2L results may not predict 1L |
| Different comparator performance | Very risky | If BCG underperformed in one trial, logic breaks |
| Different patient population | Risky | HR vs IR, CIS vs papillary |

### The Leo Thesis (Transitive Logic)

```
Premise 1: IBRX + BCG beat BCG by 24% anytime CR in 1L
Premise 2: CGON beat IBRX in 2L (better CR and durability)
Conclusion: CGON should beat BCG in 1L
```

### The Mike Challenge (Breaking Transitive Logic)

**"What I cannot reconcile is why BCG underperformed so badly there with only 61% anytime CR versus 85-90% in the trials I sent."**

If the comparator arm was anomalously weak in IBRX's trial, the apparent superiority of IBRX+BCG may be inflated. The transitive chain breaks.

**Questions to challenge transitive logic:**
1. Was the comparator arm performance in line with historical?
2. Are the settings (1L vs 2L) comparable for this drug class?
3. Are the populations identical (same severity, same prior treatment)?
4. Is the sponsor reliable (big pharma vs small biotech trial quality)?

### When to Trust vs. Distrust Transitive Logic

| Trust More | Trust Less |
|------------|------------|
| Same line of therapy | Different lines (2L→1L extrapolation) |
| Comparator matches historical | Comparator outperforms or underperforms historical |
| Large, rigorous trials | Small, single-site trials |
| Same endpoint definitions | Different CR definitions, different timepoints |
| Direct head-to-head | Indirect cross-trial comparison |

## Part 3: Comparator Skepticism

### Why Comparator Performance Varies

| Factor | Impact | How to Check |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| **Sample size** | Small n = high variance | n<50 per arm = be cautious |
| **BCG strain** | TICE vs non-TICE can differ | Check protocol for allowed strains |
| **Dosing regimen** | Induction vs maintenance | BCG-M >> BCG-I for durability |
| **Trial quality** | Site selection, protocol adherence | Big pharma > small biotech |
| **Patient selection** | Enrichment for responders | Check I/E criteria |
| **Geographic mix** | US vs ex-US can differ | JNJ mostly ex-US sites |

### The Checklist

Before accepting a comparator arm as benchmark:

- [ ] Is n > 100 for the comparator arm?
- [ ] Was the comparator regimen identical to SOC (not suboptimal)?
- [ ] Are results consistent with other large trials of same comparator?
- [ ] Was trial run by reputable sponsor with good track record?
- [ ] Were sites representative of where drug will be used?

### Example: IBRX BCG Arm Skepticism

| Question | Answer | Concern Level |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| N size? | 20 | High - too small |
| BCG regimen? | TICE, ? maintenance | Medium - verify |
| Consistent with big pharma? | No - 61% vs 85-93% | High - 24% delta |
| Sponsor quality? | "IBRX, who we know are shady" | High |
| Sites? | Unknown | Medium |

**Verdict:** Don't anchor on IBRX's BCG arm. Use big pharma benchmark instead.

## Part 4: Commercial Launch as Catalyst/Overhang

### The Raj Pattern: Launch Underwhelm → Space De-rating

**"The drug launches have been underwhelming to date... I would compare this to GA where theoretical TAM is massive, multiple folds over wet AMD which have multibillion dollar products but since Izervay and Syfovre launches are underwhelming, no one is really excited about a new GA therapy."**

### Historical Precedents

| Space | Drug(s) | Launch Reality | Space Impact |
|-------|---------|---------------|--------------|
| Geographic Atrophy | Izervay, Syfovre | Underwhelming | Entire GA space de-rated |
| Alzheimer's (amyloid) | Leqembi | Slow uptake | Next-gen amyloid lost hype |
| Muscarinics (schizophrenia) | Cobenfy | Below expectations | Muscarinic space de-rated |
| TYK2 | Sotyktu | Slow | TYK2 competitors lost interest |
| NMIBC | TAR-200 (JNJ) | TBD - early innings | Could weigh on CGON/ENGN/RLMD |

### Framework: Launch as Leading Indicator

```
If first-mover launch underwhelms:
→ TAM assumptions for entire space questioned
→ "If [Leader] can't make it work, why would [Follower]?"
→ Multiple compression across space
→ Even better drugs get de-rated
```

### The CGON/JNJ Dynamic

| Factor | Observation | Implication |
|--------|-------------|-------------|
| JNJ scripts tracking? | Yes (per JNJ IR) | Sellside doesn't know this |
| JNJ launch trajectory? | TBD - early, no J-code yet | If weak, overhang on space |
| KOL view | Products viewed as "very similar" | CGON may not differentiate |
| CYTK comp | "Nobody cared that CYTK was a little bit better" | Differentiation may not matter |

### When Launch Overhang Matters Most

| Condition | Launch Impact |
|-----------|---------------|
| Products viewed as similar | High - undifferentiated space |
| First-mover sets TAM expectations | High - anchoring effect |
| Scripts/data are trackable | High - continuous negative catalyst |
| Your product is clearly differentiated | Lower - can escape comparison |
| Different MOA or patient population | Lower - separate thesis |

### Position Implications

| Launch Trajectory | Position Recommendation |
|-------------------|------------------------|
| Strong (beats expectations) | Space tailwind; can add to followers |
| In line | Neutral; focus on differentiation |
| Weak (underwhelms) | Space headwind; trim or short followers |
| Disaster | Entire space at risk; reassess all positions |

## Part 5: Setting PoS for Single-Arm Data

### Leo's Framework

**Explicit PoS for specific thresholds:**

| Threshold | PoS | Rationale |
|-----------|-----|-----------|
| 90% anytime CR + 85% 12M EFS | 65% | Derisks monotx for 1L |
| 85% anytime CR + 80% 12M EFS | >75% | Derisks combo tx |

**This is the right format** - specific outcomes with explicit probabilities, not vague "bullish" statements.

### How to Set PoS for Single-Arm vs. Historical

1. **Define the benchmark** - What's the historical range for comparator?
2. **Define "success"** - What delta over benchmark would be meaningful?
3. **Assess variability** - What's the confidence interval on your expected result?
4. **Assign PoS** - Based on where expected result sits vs benchmark

### Example

```
BCG benchmark: 85-93% anytime CR
"Clearly better" threshold: >93% (>5% delta)
CGON expected (monotx): 87-92%

PoS for >93%: ~40% (need to beat top of BCG range)
PoS for >90%: ~65% (beat middle of BCG range)
PoS for >85%: ~85% (beat bottom of BCG range)
```

## Integration with Main PoS Framework

### Where Cross-Trial Analysis Fits

| Pillar | How Cross-Trial Analysis Informs |
|--------|----------------------------------|
| 1. Trial Design | Single-arm vs RCT implications |
| 2. Population | Match to historical comparator population |
| 3. Comparator | Historical benchmark replaces placebo analysis |
| 4. Efficacy Signal | Cross-trial delta calculation |
| 5. Competitive | Launch trajectory read-through |
| 6. Execution | Sponsor quality vs historical trial quality |

### Single-Arm Specific Adjustments

| Factor | PoS Adjustment |
|--------|---------------|
| Clear separation from historical benchmark | +10% |
| Results in range of historical benchmark | Neutral |
| Historical benchmark had high variance | -5% (harder to prove superiority) |
| Comparator in your benchmark trials underperformed | -10% (may not replicate) |
| First-in-class with no direct historical comp | -10% (uncertain benchmark) |

## Key Takeaways

1. **Set explicit bars** - "Need >93% to derisk" not "hope it's good"
2. **Challenge transitive logic** - Different settings, different comparator performance break the chain
3. **Question comparator skepticism** - Small n, weak sponsor, outlier performance = don't anchor
4. **Track launch overhang** - First-mover underwhelm de-rates entire space
5. **Quantify PoS for specific thresholds** - "65% PoS for >90% CR" not "bullish"
6. **Use big pharma trials as benchmark** - Small biotech comparator arms are unreliable
