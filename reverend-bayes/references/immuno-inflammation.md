# Immunology & Inflammation (I&I) Module

Disease-specific guidance for PoS assessment in I&I indications.

## Critical Principle: Placebo Response Dominates

In I&I, trials fail more often from unexpectedly high placebo response than from drug underperformance. Always anchor analysis on comparator arm assumptions.

## Disease-Specific Benchmarks

### Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA)

**Endpoints & Thresholds:**
| Endpoint | Regulatory Status | Typical Threshold |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| ACR20 | Primary acceptable | 20% delta vs PBO |
| ACR50 | Preferred primary | 15-20% delta |
| ACR70 | Secondary | 10-15% delta |
| DAS28-CRP remission (<2.6) | Co-primary in some | 10-15% delta |
| HAQ-DI | Secondary/PRO | 0.22 MCID |

**Placebo Response Benchmarks (Week 12-24):**
| Population | ACR20 PBO | ACR50 PBO | ACR70 PBO |
|------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| MTX-IR (biologic naive) | 25-35% | 10-15% | 3-8% |
| TNF-IR | 15-25% | 8-12% | 2-5% |
| Multi-biologic IR | 10-18% | 5-10% | 1-4% |

**Key Risk Factors:**
- Background MTX: Stabilizes placebo response but adds complexity
- Rescue medication: If allowed early, inflates placebo
- Enrollment at flare: Regression to mean risk
- Duration: >24 weeks sees placebo drift down, dropout up

**Historical PoS Reference:**
- Phase 3 RA (novel MOA): ~45-55%
- Phase 3 RA (established class): ~55-65%
- Me-too TNF inhibitor: ~70%+

### Psoriasis (Plaque)

**Endpoints & Thresholds:**
| Endpoint | Regulatory Status | Typical Threshold |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| PASI75 | Historical primary | 75% response common now |
| PASI90 | Current bar | 50-70% achievable with IL-17/23 |
| PASI100 | Differentiator | 30-50% with best agents |
| IGA 0/1 | Co-primary | Correlates with PASI |
| sPGA | Alternative | Similar to IGA |

**Placebo Response Benchmarks (Week 12-16):**
| Endpoint | Placebo Rate | Notes |
|----------|--------------|-------|
| PASI75 | 3-8% | Low and stable |
| PASI90 | 1-4% | Very low |
| PASI100 | <2% | Essentially noise |
| IGA 0/1 | 2-6% | Corresponds to PASI |

**Key Risk Factors:**
- Placebo risk is LOW - this is a good indication
- Main risk: Not differentiating from existing IL-17/IL-23 inhibitors
- Bar is very high (PASI90 >50% expected)
- Speed of onset matters for differentiation

**Historical PoS Reference:**
- Phase 3 psoriasis (good Phase 2): ~60-70%
- Phase 3 psoriasis (novel MOA): ~50-60%

### Inflammatory Bowel Disease (Crohn's, UC)

**Endpoints & Thresholds:**
| Endpoint | Regulatory Status | Typical Threshold |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Clinical remission (CDAI<150 or Mayo≤2) | Primary | Required |
| Endoscopic improvement | Co-primary increasingly | FDA emphasis |
| Clinical response | Secondary | Less meaningful |
| Corticosteroid-free remission | Key secondary | Durability measure |

**Placebo Response Benchmarks:**

*Crohn's Disease (Week 12 induction):*
| Population | Clinical Remission PBO | Endoscopic Response PBO |
|------------|------------------------|-------------------------|
| Biologic-naive | 20-30% | 10-15% |
| TNF-IR | 12-20% | 5-12% |
| Multi-mechanism IR | 8-15% | 5-10% |

*Ulcerative Colitis (Week 8-12 induction):*
| Population | Clinical Remission PBO | Endoscopic Improvement PBO |
|------------|------------------------|----------------------------|
| Biologic-naive | 8-15% | 15-25% |
| TNF-IR | 5-12% | 10-18% |

**Key Risk Factors:**
- Endoscopy requirement: Increases rigor, lowers placebo (good)
- Maintenance studies: Require re-randomization of responders
- Background therapy: 5-ASA, steroids affect interpretation
- Centralized reading: Reduces variability, recommended

**Historical PoS Reference:**
- Phase 3 IBD with good Phase 2b: ~45-55%
- Phase 3 IBD (novel MOA, unvalidated target): ~30-40%

### Atopic Dermatitis

**Endpoints & Thresholds:**
| Endpoint | Regulatory Status | Typical Threshold |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|
| IGA 0/1 + ≥2 grade improvement | Primary | FDA standard |
| EASI-75 | Co-primary | EMA emphasis |
| EASI-90 | Differentiator | New bar post-dupilumab |
| Pruritus NRS | Key secondary | Rapid onset expected |

**Placebo Response Benchmarks (Week 16):**
| Population | IGA 0/1 PBO | EASI-75 PBO |
|------------|-------------|-------------|
| Moderate-severe, biologic-naive | 8-12% | 12-18% |
| Post-biologic | 5-10% | 8-15% |

**CRITICAL: Dupilumab Benchmark Data (Phase 3)**
| Metric | Dupilumab | Placebo | Net Delta |
|--------|-----------|---------|-----------|
| EASI-75 (Week 16) | 51% | 15% | 36% |
| IGA 0/1 (Week 16) | 38% | 10% | 28% |
| EASI reduction (Week 4) | ~50% | ~15-20% | ~30-35% |
| TARC reduction | 70-80% | minimal | - |

**NKTR Rezpegaldesleukin Phase 2b Benchmark (n=393, Week 16)**
| Metric | High Dose (24µg/kg q2w) | Low Dose (24µg/kg q4w) | Placebo |
|--------|-------------------------|------------------------|---------|
| N | 104 | 110 | 73 |
| EASI-75 | 50-62%* | ~35-40% | 15-20% |
| vIGA 0/1 | 28-38%* | - | ~10% |
| EASI-90 | ~37%* | - | - |
| Treg expansion | Dose-dependent, clear | Modest | None |
*Week 16-24 data; deepening over time

**Comparative Analysis Framework for Novel AD Drugs**

When evaluating a new AD drug, benchmark against:
1. **Dupilumab** (gold standard): ~36% EASI-75 delta at week 16
2. **JAKi (Rinvoq)**: ~50% EASI-75 delta at week 16 (faster onset, safety concerns)
3. **NKTR** (if Treg mechanism): Check dose-response matches

**Questions to ask for any new AD drug:**
- Is placebo response in line with historical (12-18% EASI-75)? If higher, why?
- What's the net delta vs. placebo at comparable timepoints?
- Does biomarker kinetics (TARC, Tregs, IL-4) match the stated MOA?
- Is there dose-response on both biomarker and clinical endpoints?

**Key Risk Factors:**
- Bar raised significantly by dupilumab, JAK inhibitors
- Speed of itch relief now expected (week 2-4)
- Topical use: Background TCS affects interpretation
- Age stratification: Pediatric data often required

**Historical PoS Reference:**
- Phase 3 AD (established class): ~60-70%
- Phase 3 AD (novel MOA): ~45-55%
- Phase 2 AD (novel MOA with positive Phase 1): ~55-65%

### Asthma

**Endpoints & Thresholds:**
| Endpoint | Regulatory Status | Notes |
|----------|-------------------|-------|
| Annualized exacerbation rate | Primary | Rate ratio vs PBO |
| FEV1 | Co-primary or key secondary | Absolute change |
| ACQ/AQLQ | PRO secondary | Supportive |
| OCS reduction | Important for severe | Steroid-sparing |

**Placebo Response Benchmarks:**
- Exacerbation reduction: 30-50% even on placebo in enriched populations
- FEV1 improvement: 50-150mL on placebo (regression to mean)

**Key Risk Factors:**
- Biomarker enrichment critical (eosinophils, IgE, FeNO)
- High placebo response due to adherence improvement
- Seasonality affects exacerbation rates
- Background ICS/LABA mandatory

### Lupus (SLE)

**Endpoints & Thresholds:**
| Endpoint | Regulatory Status | Notes |
|----------|-------------------|-------|
| SRI-4 | Standard primary | Composite |
| BICLA | Alternative | Increasingly used |
| Renal response (lupus nephritis) | Separate indication | Proteinuria-based |
| Flare reduction | Key secondary | Time to first flare |

**Placebo Response Benchmarks (Week 52):**
| Endpoint | Placebo Rate |
|----------|--------------|
| SRI-4 | 30-45% |
| BICLA | 25-40% |

**Key Risk Factors:**
- Very high placebo response (biggest challenge)
- 52-week duration: Dropout 20-30%
- Heterogeneous disease: Stratification critical
- Background therapy varies widely

**Historical PoS Reference:**
- Phase 3 SLE: ~35-45% (tough indication)
- Lupus nephritis: ~40-50%

## Trial Design Considerations

### Induction vs Maintenance

**Induction trials:**
- 8-16 weeks typical
- Higher placebo response (acute setting)
- Responder definition critical for maintenance rollover

**Maintenance trials:**
- Re-randomize induction responders
- Lower placebo "response" (actually relapse rate)
- Duration 52+ weeks
- Dropout is major issue

### Enrichment Strategies

**Acceptable enrichment (reduces placebo, increases signal):**
- Biomarker selection (if validated)
- Prior treatment failure (TNF-IR)
- Objective disease severity threshold

**Risky enrichment:**
- Over-selection limits generalizability
- May not reflect real-world population
- Regulatory pushback if too narrow

### Background Therapy

**Standard approach:**
- Stable background required (MTX in RA, 5-ASA in IBD)
- No changes X weeks before/during study
- Rescue allowed but censored or analyzed separately

**Monotherapy studies:**
- Higher bar, cleaner signal
- May not reflect clinical practice
- Regulatory may require combo data anyway

## Bayesian Prior Construction for I&I

### Historical Base Rates by Indication

| Indication | Phase 2→3 PoS | Phase 3 Success | Notes |
|------------|---------------|-----------------|-------|
| RA | 55% | 50-60% | Well-characterized |
| Psoriasis | 65% | 60-70% | Low placebo risk |
| Crohn's | 45% | 40-50% | Placebo challenge |
| UC | 50% | 45-55% | Similar to CD |
| Atopic dermatitis | 55% | 50-60% | Bar rising |
| Asthma | 50% | 45-55% | Enrichment dependent |
| SLE | 35% | 30-40% | Hardest indication |

### Adjustment Factors

**Increase prior by 5-15% if:**
- Target previously validated (me-too)
- Strong biomarker correlation in Phase 2
- Experienced sponsor in indication
- Adaptive design with interim

**Decrease prior by 5-15% if:**
- Novel target (first-in-class)
- Phase 2 underpowered or open-label
- Inexperienced sponsor
- High placebo risk indication
- Changing SOC landscape

## Expansion Indication Framework

When a drug shows activity in one I&I indication, assess expansion potential systematically.

### Asthma (from AD lead)

**Biological plausibility:**
- IL-4, IL-5, IL-13 suppression relevant (Th2-driven)
- Treg modulation could help (regulatory failure component)
- ACQ-5 co-primary signal in AD+asthma patients is supportive

**Benchmark data (NKTR):**
- Pre-specified subgroup in AD trial showed ACQ-5 improvement
- Improvement comparable to dupilumab in asthma
- Supports ~40-50% conditional PoS if AD works

**Credit level: 30-50% of AD success value**

### Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS)

**Biological plausibility:**
- IL-17 is key driver; need substantial IL-17 suppression
- Treg modulation less established in HS pathophysiology
- TNF inhibitors work; IL-17 inhibitors mixed results

**Benchmark:**
- Successful HS drugs show major IL-17 suppression
- If new drug shows only modest IL-17 reduction (10-20%), unlikely competitive

**Credit level: 10-20% speculative if IL-17 reduction is modest**

### Psoriasis (from AD lead)

**Biological plausibility:**
- Th17-driven, so IL-17 suppression critical
- Less Th2 component than AD

**Benchmark:**
- Bar is very high (PASI 90 > 50% with IL-17/IL-23 inhibitors)
- Need substantial IL-17 effect to be competitive

**Credit level: 20-30% if MOA has IL-17 component**

### IBD (from AD lead)

**Biological plausibility:**
- Complex pathophysiology (Th1, Th17, epithelial)
- Treg approaches have struggled (low IL-2 trials failed)
- Need to show gut-specific activity

**Credit level: 10-20% speculative; need direct data**
