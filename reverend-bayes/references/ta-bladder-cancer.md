## NMIBC (Non-Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer)

### Risk Stratification (AUA/EAU)

| Risk Category | Characteristics | 12-Month RFS (TURBT alone) | Standard Treatment |
|---------------|-----------------|---------------------------|-------------------|
| Low Risk | Solitary LG Ta ≤3cm | 70-80% | TURBT + surveillance |
| Intermediate Risk (IR) | Recurrent LG Ta, Multifocal LG Ta, LG T1, Solitary HG Ta ≤3cm | 50-65% | TURBT ± periop chemo, BCG may be considered |
| High Risk (HR) | HG T1, HG Ta >3cm, CIS ± papillary | 30-45% | TURBT + BCG induction + maintenance |
| BCG-Unresponsive | Failed adequate BCG (induction + maintenance) | 15-25% | Radical cystectomy or salvage therapy |

### Key Pattern: Perioperative Chemo US Adoption Reality

**Database studies show 10-15% US adoption, not majority:**

| Study | Population | Finding |
|-------|------------|---------|
| Lee 2022 | US database | ~10-15% receive perioperative intravesical chemo |
| Lewicki 2022 | US database | Similar findings - low adoption |
| NCCN 2024 | Guidelines | Single instillation "most efficacious in low-grade low-volume Ta, not effective in higher-risk" |

**Why so low (despite guideline recommendation)?**
1. **Operationally cumbersome** - Requires OR coordination, instillation during procedure
2. **AE concerns** - Bleeding, UTI, contraindications common
3. **Modest perceived payoff** - Marginal benefit perception, especially in higher-risk
4. **Not effective in higher-risk** - Per NCCN, limited to low-grade, low-volume Ta

**Critical insight:** Mike's table showing 88% TURBT-alone RFS used ex-US studies where periop chemo IS standard. US real-world experience is different.

### Key Pattern: FDA Control Arm Precedent

**RLMD ATLAS used "TURBT + observation" control in IR NMIBC Phase 3:**
- If FDA allows observation control for competitor, establishes precedent
- Suggests FDA doesn't consider TURBT + intravesical chemo as required SOC
- Inference: CGON can use same design without regulatory pushback

### PIVOT-006 Trial Design (CGON - Cretostimogene)

**Population:** IR NMIBC
- Recurrent LG Ta ≤12 months
- Solitary LG Ta >3cm
- LG Ta multifocal
- LG T1
- Solitary HG Ta ≤3cm (capped <25% enrollment)

**Design Features:**
- n=364 (reduced from 426 ~6 months post-initiation)
- North America only
- Allows perioperative chemo (stratified)
- HG enrollment capped <25%
- Primary endpoint: Event-driven RFS rate

**Key Pattern: Trial Design Signals**
Sample size reduction from 426→364 at ~6 months suggests:
- Faster enrollment than expected, OR
- Faster event accrual than expected, OR
- Both

CGON enrollment ~18 pts/month vs URGN ATLAS 10-11 pts/month → meaningfully faster

### Control Arm Expectations

**LA's 50-65% control range rationale:**

| Factor | Impact on 12m RFS | Source |
|--------|-------------------|--------|
| HG biology (<25%) | 10-15% lower than pure LG | EORTC model |
| Periop chemo (~30%) | +10% incremental | KOL feedback |
| Mixed tumor burden | Higher than ATLAS (includes HG) | Management Q&A |

**KOL estimates:**
- TURBT-only: 45-60%
- TURBT + periop chemo: 55-70%

### HR NMIBC Efficacy Hierarchy (Cross-Trial Meta-Analysis)

**Pattern: Build efficacy ladder to establish where drug fits**

| Treatment | HG-RFS 3mo | HG-RFS 6mo | Source |
|-----------|------------|------------|--------|
| Post-TURBT Cretostimogene | 96% | 85% | n=56, HR papillary-only BCG-unresponsive |
| Other active therapies | 73% | 58% | Chemo, PD1, Adstiladrin, Anktiva+BCG |

**Delta: ~20% efficacy spread for cretostimogene vs other active drugs**

**Hierarchy established:**
TURBT + creto > TURBT + other active adjuvant > TURBT alone

### Power/Simulation Framework

**From SUO 2023 abstract:**
- Designed for 10% absolute improvement
- 90% power

**LA/Ming Zhu simulation:**
- Event trigger must be LOW: ≤50-55% of 364 pts (183-202 events)
- Control arm 12m RFS must be LOW: 50-55%
- For creto to achieve ≥70% RFS, control must be ≤55%
- ~15% delta with close to 12m minimum follow-up → >90% power
- 10-12% delta needed for 75% power
- 8-9% delta needed for statistical significance

### Clinical Bar (KOL View)

**70-80% RFS at 12 months = good enough for broad IR NMIBC use**
- Safety requirements emphasized
- Post-TURBT chemo viewed as potential "overkill" in IR ("killing fly with hammer")

### Key Debates

**Mike's Bear Case:**
1. TURBT alone achieves ~88% 12m RFS in IR (per ex-US studies)
2. Cohort P (HR papillary-only, non-CIS): 80% RFS at 9m = no different than TURBT alone
3. Trial lacks periop chemo = not SOC
4. Creto may not work in IR if TURBT clears all tumor (nothing to transfect)

**ZH's Bull View:**
- Trial will hit: >80% vs 50% RFS at 12m, HR <0.65
- Data will support approval (observation is SOC per FDA)
- 100% clinical PoS, discount only for CMC

**Resolution (LA):**
- Mike's 88% benchmark uses ex-US data where periop chemo is routine
- US reality: 10-15% periop chemo adoption → control will be lower
- Point estimate: ~15-20% delta all-comers, depending on LG Ta >3cm enrollment

## Pattern Index

|---------|-------------|--------|
| US periop chemo adoption reality | 10-15%, not majority; ex-US overstates | LA (CGON), Lee 2022, Lewicki 2022 |
| Trial design signals | Sample size reduction → faster enrollment/events | LA (CGON) |
| FDA control precedent | Competitor control design = acceptable | LA (CGON), RLMD ATLAS |
| Cross-trial efficacy hierarchy | Build efficacy ladder across trials | LA (CGON) |
| Management Q&A gap-filling | Direct engagement for specific gaps | LA (CGON) |
