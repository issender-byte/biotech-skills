# PoS Scorecard Rubric

Detailed scoring criteria for each of the six pillars. Score 1-10 with explicit justification.

## Scoring Philosophy

- **1-3**: Major concerns, significant risk factor
- **4-5**: Below average, notable concerns
- **6-7**: Average, typical risk level
- **8-9**: Above average, favorable factors
- **10**: Exceptional, minimal risk

Default to 5-6 absent specific positive or negative factors. Deviation from default requires explicit justification.

| 2 | Phase 2 nominally significant but wide CI; no clear dose-response; open-label component |

## Aggregation to PoS Range

### Score Mapping

| Total Score | Category | PoS Range | Confidence |
|-------------|----------|-----------|------------|
| 50-60 | High | 55-75% | Strong base case |
| 42-49 | Above Average | 45-60% | Favorable setup |
| 35-41 | Average | 35-50% | Typical risk |
| 28-34 | Below Average | 25-40% | Elevated risk |
| 20-27 | Low | 15-30% | High risk |
| <20 | Very Low | <20% | Major concerns |

### Range Width Determination

- **Narrow range (10%)**: High certainty; good data; stable context
- **Standard range (15%)**: Typical uncertainty; some unknowns
- **Wide range (20%+)**: High uncertainty; missing data; volatile context

### Documenting Range Drivers

For every assessment, explicitly state:
1. What moves to top of range (best case assumptions)
2. What moves to bottom of range (worst case assumptions)
3. What additional diligence would narrow the range
