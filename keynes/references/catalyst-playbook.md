# Catalyst Playbook

Framework for positioning around biotech catalysts.

---

## Overview

Catalyst analysis answers: **When will the market re-rate, and how do I position?**

Key components:
1. **Catalyst type profiles** — What kind of event and typical behavior
2. **Pre-event positioning** — How to enter
3. **Post-event patterns** — How stocks typically behave
4. **Expected value framework** — When to hold through vs. reduce

---

## Catalyst Type Profiles

### Phase 3 Data Readout

**Characteristics:**
- Stock often runs 10-30% into data
- Volatility spikes approaching readout
- Analyst previews published
- Options implied move provides guidance

**Typical Moves:**
| Outcome | Stock Reaction |
|---------|----------------|
| Clear positive | Gap up 30-80%, may consolidate |
| Positive but complex | Volatile, wait 2-3 days |
| Mixed/unclear | -10% to +10%, then drift |
| Negative | Gap down 40-70% |

**Positioning Strategy:**
| Conviction | Pre-Data | Post-Data |
|------------|----------|-----------|
| Very high | Full position through | Add on dip if positive |
| High | 75% through | Evaluate |
| Moderate | 50% through | Reduce before event |
| Low | Minimal or none | — |

### FDA Decision (PDUFA)

**Characteristics:**
- Premium builds 1-2 weeks before
- Lower volatility than Phase 3 (more predictable)
- CRL risk often partially priced
- Binary outcome

**Key Question:** Is CRL risk priced in?

| Signal | CRL Risk Priced | CRL Risk NOT Priced |
|--------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Stock at discount to peers | Yes | — |
| Options skew to puts | Yes | — |
| Sellside cautious | Yes | — |
| Stock at premium | — | No |
| "Approval is a formality" | — | No |

**Typical Moves:**
| Outcome | Stock Reaction |
|---------|----------------|
| Clean approval | +10-30% (less than Phase 3) |
| Approval with label issues | Flat to -10% |
| CRL (expected) | -20-40% |
| CRL (unexpected) | -40-70% |

---

### Advisory Committee (AdCom)

**Characteristics:**
- High uncertainty (committee dynamics)
- Stock often volatile day-of
- Vote counts matter less than discussion
- FDA not bound by AdCom

**How to Trade:**
- Don't size heavily pre-AdCom
- Watch live if possible (discussion tone)
- Initial reaction often overreacts both directions

**Typical Moves:**
| Outcome | Stock Reaction |
|---------|----------------|
| Strong positive vote | +20-40% |
| Split vote, positive | +5-15%, volatile |
| Split vote, negative | -15-30% |
| Strong negative vote | -30-50% |

---

### Earnings Report

**Characteristics:**
- Predictable timing
- Commercial traction focus
- Management commentary important
- Lower binary risk than clinical

**What Moves Stock:**
| Factor | High Impact | Low Impact |
|--------|------------|------------|
| Revenue beat/miss | Yes | — |
| New starts trajectory | Yes (launch phase) | — |
| Guidance revision | Yes | — |
| Pipeline update | Sometimes | Often |
| Cash runway | If short | Usually |

---

### Conference Presentation

**Characteristics:**
- Lower impact than data readout
- New data can move stock
- Management tone matters
- Often priced in advance

**When Conferences Matter:**
- First look at new data
- Updated data with longer follow-up
- Competitive landscape shifts
- Unexpected announcements

---

## Pre-Event Positioning

### Entry Timing Framework

| Situation | Entry Strategy |
|-----------|----------------|
| Data in 1-2 weeks, stock flat | Enter now |
| Data in 1-2 weeks, stock run 20%+ | Wait for pullback or reduce size |
| Data uncertain timing | Small starter, add on clarity |
| Data imminent, high conviction | Full position |
| Data imminent, moderate conviction | Half position |

### Pre-Event Run Dynamics

| Pre-Event Move | Interpretation | Action |
|----------------|----------------|--------|
| No run | Market skeptical | Opportunity if bullish |
| 10-20% run | Normal anticipation | Standard position |
| 30%+ run | Priced for success | Reduce size or trim |
| Decline into data | Market bearish | Opportunity if contrarian |

---

## Post-Event Patterns

### Positive Data

| Pattern | Timing | Strategy |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Gap up, hold | Day 1-2 | Continue holding |
| Gap up, fade | Day 1-3 | May add on pullback |
| Gap up, then grind higher | Week 1-4 | Hold, analyst upgrades coming |
| Gap up, then give back gains | Week 2-4 | Reassess thesis |

### Negative Data

| Pattern | Timing | Strategy |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Gap down, stabilize | Day 1-3 | Assess if thesis still valid |
| Gap down, continued selling | Day 1-5 | Exit; don't catch knife |
| Gap down, then recovery | Week 2-4 | May be opportunity if market overreacted |

---

## Expected Value Framework

### When to Hold Through Binary

Calculate expected value of holding:

```
EV = (P(success) × Upside%) + (P(failure) × Downside%)

If EV > 0, holding has positive expected value
If EV < 0, consider reducing
```

**Example:**
- P(success) = 60%
- Upside = +50%
- P(failure) = 40%
- Downside = -60%

EV = (0.6 × 50%) + (0.4 × -60%) = 30% - 24% = +6%

→ Positive EV, but barely. Consider position sizing.

### Position Size for Binaries

| EV | Position Size |
|----|---------------|
| >+20% | Full conviction |
| +10-20% | 75% position |
| +5-10% | 50% position |
| 0-5% | 25% or none |
| <0% | Don't hold through |

## Catalyst Calendar Management

### Tracking Framework

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| Ticker | — |
| Catalyst | What event |
| Date | When expected |
| Date certainty | Fixed/Window/TBD |
| Your PoS | Probability assessment |
| Street PoS | Market expectation |
| Gap | Your edge |
| Position | Current holding |
| Plan | Pre-event action |

### Catalyst Clustering Risk

When multiple holdings have same-month catalysts:
- Increases portfolio volatility
- May need to reduce positions
- Consider correlation (same mechanism = correlated risk)

## Key Principles

1. **Respect the run** — 30%+ pre-event run means success is priced
2. **Size to the EV** — Positive EV doesn't mean full position
3. **Don't catch knives** — Failed data rarely recovers quickly
4. **Watch the fade** — Post-data fade often means more downside
5. **Analyst upgrades lag** — Price often moves before ratings
6. **Options tell truth** — Implied move is market's view
