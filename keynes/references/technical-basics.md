# Technical Analysis Basics for Biotech

Simplified technical framework for biotech position management.

---

## Philosophy

Technical analysis in biotech is for **timing and risk management**, not predicting fundamentals.

**What technicals can do:**
- Identify support/resistance levels for entry/exit
- Confirm or question fundamental thesis
- Manage position around key levels
- Identify when a stock is "broken"

**What technicals cannot do:**
- Predict clinical trial outcomes
- Override fundamental analysis
- Predict overnight gaps (binary events)
- Tell you long-term fair value

---

## Core Concepts

### Support and Resistance

**Support:** Price level where buying pressure tends to emerge
- Previous lows
- Round numbers ($50, $100)
- Cash per share (fundamental floor)
- 52-week low

**Resistance:** Price level where selling pressure tends to emerge
- Previous highs
- Round numbers
- Pre-data peak
- 52-week high

### Volume

**Volume confirms price:**
- Price up + volume up = conviction
- Price up + volume down = weak rally
- Price down + volume up = distribution
- Price down + volume down = weak selling

**Average volume comparison:**
- 2x+ average = significant
- 0.5x average = weak
- Volume spikes often mark turning points

## Key Levels for Biotech

### Cash Floor

The single most important technical level:

```
Cash Floor = (Cash + Cash Equivalents) / Shares Outstanding
```

**Why it matters:**
- Stocks rarely trade below cash for extended periods
- Provides downside floor for shorts
- Can be breached briefly but usually recovers
- Acquisition premium built on top of cash

**Exception:** Burning cash rapidly (runway <12 months)

### 52-Week Range

| Position in Range | Interpretation |
|-------------------|----------------|
| Near 52-week high | Either breakout or resistance |
| Near 52-week low | Either support or breakdown |
| Middle of range | Less clear technical signal |

### Data-Driven Levels

| Level | Significance |
|-------|--------------|
| Pre-data high | Resistance if data disappoints |
| Post-data gap fill | Common pattern |
| Offering price | Often becomes support |
| Prior financing levels | Investor cost basis |

---

## Volume Patterns

### Accumulation

Signs of institutional buying:
- Steady price increase on rising volume
- Volume higher on up days vs. down days
- Price holding above support
- Pullbacks on lower volume

### Distribution

Signs of institutional selling:
- Price stalling on high volume
- Failed breakout attempts
- Lower highs on each rally
- Rallies on declining volume

### Climax Volume

| Type | Pattern | Implication |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **Buying climax** | Huge up move, massive volume | Often marks short-term top |
| **Selling climax** | Huge down move, massive volume | Often marks bottom |

---

## Gap Analysis

### Gap Types

| Gap Type | Description | Tendency |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Common gap** | No news, low volume | Usually fills |
| **Breakaway gap** | Starts new trend | Often doesn't fill |
| **Data gap** | Clinical/regulatory news | Usually doesn't fill |
| **Exhaustion gap** | End of extended move | Usually fills |

### Biotech-Specific Gaps

| Cause | Fill Likelihood |
|-------|-----------------|
| Positive Phase 3 | Low (new information) |
| Negative Phase 3 | Low (permanent impairment) |
| FDA approval | Low to medium |
| FDA CRL | Low to medium |
| Earnings beat/miss | Higher (less binary) |
| Conference presentation | Higher |

**Key rule:** Don't fade fundamental gaps. They represent new information, not technical noise.

## Moving Averages

### Common Averages

| Average | Timeframe | Use |
|---------|-----------|-----|
| 20-day | Short-term | Recent trend |
| 50-day | Medium-term | Intermediate trend |
| 200-day | Long-term | Major trend |

### Simple Interpretation

| Price vs. MAs | Signal |
|---------------|--------|
| Above all MAs | Uptrend |
| Below all MAs | Downtrend |
| Crossing above 200-day | Potential trend change (bullish) |
| Crossing below 200-day | Potential trend change (bearish) |

### Biotech Caveat

Moving averages are less useful in biotech because:
- Binary events can change trend overnight
- Fundamentals drive long-term price
- Trends get reset by data

---

## Stops and Risk Management

### Setting Stop Levels

| Method | Level |
|--------|-------|
| **Technical support** | Just below key support level |
| **Cash floor** | Below cash per share (if applicable) |
| **Percentage** | -15% to -25% from entry |
| **Volatility-adjusted** | 2-3x ATR below entry |

### Mental vs. Hard Stops

| Type | Pros | Cons |
|------|------|------|
| **Hard stop** | Discipline; automatic | Can get triggered on noise |
| **Mental stop** | Flexibility; context | Requires discipline |

**Biotech recommendation:** Mental stops with hard review triggers.

### Stop Placement Errors

| Error | Problem |
|-------|---------|
| Too tight | Stopped out on normal volatility |
| Too wide | Risk too much on wrong idea |
| Below obvious level | Everyone's stop is there |
| Moving stop down | Rationalizing bad position |

---

## Practical Application

### Entry Tactics

| Situation | Entry Approach |
|-----------|----------------|
| Strong fundamental case, stock at support | Buy now |
| Strong case, stock extended | Wait for pullback to support |
| Moderate case, uncertain timing | Scale in over time |
| Weak case | Don't override with technicals |

### Exit Tactics

| Situation | Exit Approach |
|-----------|---------------|
| Hits target, still at resistance | Take partial profits |
| Breaks below support | Exit or reduce |
| Fundamental thesis changed | Exit regardless of technicals |
| Stop triggered | Exit per plan |

---

## Biotech-Specific Patterns

### The "Data Run"

Pattern: Stock rises 20-40% into anticipated positive data

| Phase | Characteristics |
|-------|-----------------|
| Anticipation (4-8 weeks) | Gradual rise, analysts positive |
| Acceleration (1-2 weeks) | Sharp rise, volume picks up |
| Peak (day before) | Often highest point pre-data |

**Trading implication:** If you missed the run, don't chase. Wait for post-data opportunity.

### The "Post-Data Fade"

Pattern: Positive data, initial spike, then fade

**Why it happens:**
- "Sell the news" after "buy the rumor"
- Profit-taking by pre-data holders
- Debate emerges about data quality
- Analyst ratings lag price

**Opportunity:** If thesis intact, post-data fade can be entry point.

### The "Dead Cat Bounce"

Pattern: Big drop on bad news, brief rally, then continued decline

**Characteristics:**
- Initial drop 40-70%
- Bounce of 10-20%
- Low volume on bounce
- Continued selling resumes

**Warning:** Don't buy the initial bounce after bad data. Wait for stabilization.

## When Technicals Help vs. Don't Help

### When Technicals Help

| Situation | How Technicals Help |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Timing entry on pullback | Identify support levels |
| Setting stops | Define risk level |
| Position sizing | Volatility-adjust size |
| Taking profits | Identify resistance |
| Confirming breakdown | Volume + price pattern |

### When Technicals Don't Help

| Situation | Why |
|-----------|-----|
| Predicting data outcomes | Fundamentals matter |
| Overnight gaps (binary) | No technical prediction |
| Long-term fair value | Graham's domain |
| Fundamental thesis | Bayes/Snow territory |

## Golden Rules

1. **Fundamentals first** — Technicals for timing, not deciding
2. **Respect cash floor** — Stocks rarely trade below cash
3. **Gaps are information** — Don't fade fundamental gaps
4. **Volume confirms** — Price move without volume is suspect
5. **Don't over-complicate** — Support, resistance, volume. That's it.
